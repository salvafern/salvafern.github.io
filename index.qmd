------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a computational biologist working at delivering techonology solutions that scientists need. My work is focused on research software development and management of geospatial data. I actively maintain a number of R packages and collaborate with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). Occasionally I deliver workshops and contributions to conferences.
